            <h1>Welcome to FictionFolder</h1>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Daniel. I'm the founder and developer of FictionFolder.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also a writer who just really, really wants to figure out what it takes to write a decent story.
                I've been writing for over four years, and I've tried writing Science Fiction and Literary Fiction, 100,000 word stories and 7,000 word stories.
                I've taken classes and I've read blog posts.
                I've talked to other people and I've talked to myself (a lot).
                And--of course---I've written like my life depends on it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can't---unfortunately---build an app that teaches you how to write.
                Maybe someday, but FictionFolder has much humbler aspirations.
                Because, while I've been writing and trying out new styles, I've used a bunch of different tools, too.
                Google Docs and NotePad for writing. Pinterest and Google Keep for characters and settings.
                And Google Maps, Wikipedia, Fantasy Map creators, and Fantasy Name generators for a host of other things.
            </p>
            <p>
                And that's just the stuff online. What about the writing desk?
                (You don't want to know what it looks like).
                And there're the countless folders and binders, not to mention the Dictionary, the Thesaurus, and the self-help writing paperbacks.
            </p>
            <p>
                I figured that if there was anything I could do to help other writers out, it would have something to do with that.
                I built a character designer for all your brain children.
                A Worldbuilder so you don't constantly have to look up the same Wikipedia article.
                A Plotbuilder so you don't have to mess around with the nested lists on Google Docs until the end of time.
            </p>
            <p>
                And I know that it isn't perfect.
                My Text Editor doesn't even come close to rivaling Google Docs.
                (Yes, that means I forgive you for using it.)
                And there are other apps and services that have put hundreds of hours into developing state-of-the-art writing tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I hope that FictionFolder helps you stay organized as a writer.
                And as the app continues to develop, I hope that it'll get better and better at it.
                But even if saves you just a few headaches and lost papers, I've done my job.
            </p>
